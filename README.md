## Best practices

- Ensure that everything you are naming is clear and concise, reflecting the content and purpose. Use descriptive terms that are easily understandable by community members. Ask: What will people search for?
- Create folders or subdirectories within your GitHub repository corresponding to each topic area. For example, you can have folders named "NLP", "Generative AI", "Computer Vision", etc. to organize discussions, projects, or resources related to each practice area.
- Please use appropriate tags when you start discussions within the repository. This will help in categorizing and filtering content effectively.
- Regularly review and update the structure based on community feedback and evolving needs to ensure it remains relevant and useful.
